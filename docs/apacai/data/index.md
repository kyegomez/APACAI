Swarms provides several abstractions for working with data.

**Artifacts** are used for passing different types of data, such as text, lists, and blobs, between Swarms components.

**Embedding drivers** are used to generate vector embeddings from text.

**Chunkers** are used to split arbitrarily long text into chunks of certain token length.

**Loaders** are used to load textual data from different sources.

**Query engines** are used to search text storages.

**Vector drivers** are used to store and query vector databases.
