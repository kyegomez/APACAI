## **Reward Matrix for Compute Providers in Partnership with Agora**

**Objective**: To incentivize cloud providers to support Andromeda's growth by offering a structured reward matrix. This matrix is designed to ensure mutual growth and long-term collaboration. 

| **Stages** | **Reward/Incentive** | **Description** | **Potential Amount/Reward** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Stage 1: Establish Core Services** |
| Usage-Based API | Revenue Share | Share of the revenue generated from every API call | 10% of $0.01 per API call |
| Subscription Models | Revenue Share | Share of revenue from every subscription plan sold | 5% of subscription price |
| Freemium Model | Bonus | For every user that upgrades from free to advanced | $2 per upgrade |
| **Stage 2: Expand the Monetization Horizons** |
| Consulting Deals | Referral Bonus | For every consulting deal sourced or facilitated by the provider | 5% of deal value |
| Dedicated Capacity | Discounted Rates | Special rates for compute providers who want dedicated access | 20% discount |
| Licensing the Technology | Licensing Share | Share of revenue from licenses sold | 7% of license price |
| Custom Development | Project-based Bonus | Bonus on projects facilitated by or sourced via the provider | 5-10% of project value |
| **Stage 3: Form Strategic Partnerships** |
| Partnerships | Mutual Promotion | Promote the provider in joint ventures and shared platforms | Joint branding and marketing |
| Sponsorships | Joint Sponsorship | Co-sponsor events or projects with the compute provider | Varies based on event/project |
| **Stage 4: Leverage the Community** |
| Open Source Contributor Recognition | Community Recognition | Recognize key contributors from the provider's side | Special mentions, certificates |

### **Notes**:

- **Revenue Share**: The revenue-sharing model is designed to give a percentage of the income from a particular service to the compute provider. This ensures that the more users or clients Andromeda attracts, the more the provider earns.

- **Referral Bonus**: If the compute provider facilitates or introduces a consulting deal, they receive a part of the deal value.

- **Discounted Rates**: Offering exclusive discounts to the providers ensures they can access our services at a preferential rate.

- **Licensing Share**: If a company wants to utilize Andromeda for their proprietary use, a share of this license revenue goes to the provider.

- **Project-based Bonus**: On custom projects, a percentage of the project's value is given as a bonus to the provider if they play a significant role in its facilitation or execution.

- **Mutual Promotion**: By co-branding, both Andromeda and the compute provider can enjoy shared visibility and user trust.

- **Community Recognition**: Recognizing contributors not only from the open-source community but also from our partners (like compute providers) fosters collaboration and goodwill.


### **Potential Contract Outline**:

**1. Introduction**:
- Parties Involved
- Purpose of Partnership
- Definitions of Important Terms
  
**2. Terms of Partnership**:
- Duration
- Scope of Work 
- Responsibilities of Each Party
  
**3. Financial Arrangements**:
