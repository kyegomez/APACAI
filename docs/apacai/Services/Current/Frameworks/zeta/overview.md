**Zeta: Revolutionizing The Future of PyTorch Modules**

## **Overview**

In today's landscape, the demand for state-of-the-art models is ever-increasing. Developers need platforms that not only simplify but also supercharge their machine learning endeavours. Enter *Zeta* â€” the apex of the modern PyTorch framework.

Zeta delivers on the promise of modularity, reliability, usability, and speed. More than just a tool, Zeta represents the next evolutionary step in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Foundation Models. Our emphasis on trust boundaries, schema validation, and activity-level permissions signifies that with Zeta, one doesn't have to choose between efficiency and safety.

|                   | **Eliminate**                 | **Reduce**                   | **Raise**                      | **Create**                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Usability**     | - Complex Error Messages      | - Redundancies               | - Pythonic Methods             | - Stepwise Error Handling  |
| **Reliability**   | - Unnecessary Dependencies    | - Resource Waste             | - High-performance Designs    | - Strict Schema Validation |
| **Speed**         | - Lag & Latency               | - Computational Overheads    | - Optimized Functions         | - Next-gen Attention Mechanisms |
| **Modularity**    | - Rigid Design Frameworks     | - Over-complicated Functions | - Customizability             | - Plug-and-play Modules    |

### **Zeta's Manifesto**

- **The Current World**: Today, ML developers are burdened by rigid frameworks and limited scalability. There is a palpable need for a transformative solution.
  
- **The Ideal Future**: A world where developers can access and implement SOTA models seamlessly. But the bridge - a framework combining speed, reliability, modularity, and usability - is currently missing.
  
- **The Barrier**: To date, no framework has successfully bridged this gap. The enormity of the task requires X (optimization at the foundational level), Y (unwavering focus on user experience), and Z (a forward-thinking design philosophy).
  
- **Our Secret Sauce**: Zeta's secret lies in its unique ability to blend the demands of advanced computational requirements with user-centric designs. Our innovations, like FlashAttention and MultiQueryAttention, are just a glimpse of our capabilities.
  
- **Why Zeta?**: Our unmatched experience, combined with an unwavering commitment to excellence, positions Zeta as the best and only choice for the discerning developer.

### **Quick Starts**
  
#### **Effortless Installation**
```
pip3 install zeta 
```

#### **Experience FlashAttention**

Harness the power of the best and most efficient attention mechanisms like FlashAttention:
```python
import torch
from zeta import FlashAttention

q = torch.randn(2, 4, 6, 8)
k = torch.randn(2, 4, 10, 8)
v = torch.randn(2, 4, 10, 8)

attention = FlashAttention(causal=False, dropout=0.1, flash=False)
output = attention(q, k, v)

print(output.shape) 
```

#### **Unlock GPT-4's Potential**

Discover how Zeta offers rough implementations of groundbreaking models such as GPT-4:
```python
import torch
from zeta import GPT4, GPT4MultiModal

# For text-based tasks
text = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024)).cuda()
img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

gpt4_language = GPT4()
gpt4_language(text)

# For multi-modal tasks
gpt4_multimodal = GPT4MultiModal()
gpt4_multimodal_output = gpt4_multimodal(text, img)
```
