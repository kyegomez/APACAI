2. **Violence from Replicants:** Due to their mistreatment, replicants often rebelled violently, which posed significant risks to human safety and resulted in bad publicity for the corporation.

3. **Death of the Founder:** The death of Dr. Eldon Tyrell, at the hands of a replicant, led to the downfall of the corporation.
