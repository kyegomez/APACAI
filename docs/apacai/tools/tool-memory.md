Tool memory augments activity inputs and outputs with storage capabilities. It's a way to keep any data generated by tools off prompt but still allow LLMs to operate on that data remotely. This is useful in the following scenarios:

* **Security requirements**: many organizations don't want data to leave their cloud for regulatory and security reasons.
* **Long textual content**: when textual content returned by tools can't fit in the token limit, it's often useful to perform operations on it in a separate process, not in the main LLM.
* **Non-textual content**: tools can generate images, videos, PDFs, and other non-textual content that can be stored in memory and acted upon later by other tools.

By default, Swarms augments all tool outputs with `TextToolMemory` but you can override at the structure, task, or tool activity level.

Here is an end-to-end example of how memory can be used in unison with multiple tools to store and load content:

```python
from swarms.memory.tool import TextToolMemory, BlobToolMemory
from swarms.structures import Agent
from swarms.tools import WebScraper, FileManager, ToolOutputProcessor

"""
Define tool memory for storing textual and
non-textual content.
"""
text_memory = TextToolMemory(
    # Disable all memory activities, so we can use
    # ToolOutputProcessor as a tool later.
    allowlist=[]
)
blob_memory = BlobToolMemory()

"""
WebScraper enables LLMs to web pages.

Here we wrap WebScraper's `get_content` activity
in the text memory. Any result from this
activity will be stored in that memory and the result
ID will be returned to the LLM.
"""
web_scraper = WebScraper(
    output_memory={
        "get_content": [text_memory]
    }
)

"""
FileManager enables LLMs to store and load files from disk.

Here we set input_memory for tool activities to pull data from and
wrap the `load_files_from_disk` activity output with the blob memory.
"""
file_manager = FileManager(
    input_memory=[text_memory],
    output_memory={
        "load_files_from_disk": [blob_memory]
    }
)

"""
ToolOutputProcessor enables LLMs to browse, extract, and query text memory.
"""
memory_browser = ToolOutputProcessor(
    input_memory=[text_memory]
)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[web_scraper, file_manager, memory_browser]
)

agent.run(
    "Load https://www.swarms.ai, summarize it, "
    "and store it in swarms.txt"
)
```
