The Swarms framework provides developers with the ability to create AI systems that operate across two dimensions: **predictability** and **creativity**. 

For **predictability**, Swarms enforces structures like sequential pipelines, DAG-based workflows, and long-term memory. To facilitate creativity, Swarms safely prompts LLMs with tools and short-term memory connecting them to external APIs and data stores. The framework allows developers to transition between those two dimensions effortlessly based on their use case.

Swarms not only helps developers harness the potential of LLMs but also enforces trust boundaries, schema validation, and tool activity-level permissions. By doing so, Swarms maximizes LLMs’ reasoning while adhering to strict policies regarding their capabilities.

Swarms’s design philosophy is based on the following tenets:

1. **Modularity and composability**: All framework primitives are useful and usable on their own in addition to being easy to plug into each other.
2. **Technology-agnostic**: Swarms is designed to work with any capable LLM, data store, and backend through the abstraction of drivers.
3. **Keep data off prompt by default**: When working with data through loaders and tools, Swarms aims to keep it off prompt by default, making it easy to work with big data securely and with low latency.
4. **Minimal prompt engineering**: It’s much easier to reason about code written in Python, not natural languages. Swarms aims to default to Python in most cases unless absolutely necessary.

## Quick Starts

First, configure an OpenAI client by [getting an API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and adding it to your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If no specific [PromptDriver](structures/prompt-drivers.md) is defined, Swarms uses [OpenAI Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) to execute LLM prompts. 

### Using pip

Install **swarms** and **swarms-tools**:

```
pip install swarms swarms-tools -U
```

### Using Poetry

To get started with Swarms using Poetry first create a new poetry project from the terminal: 

```
poetry new swarms-quickstart
```

Change your working directory to the new `swarms-quickstart` directory created by Poetry and add the dependencies. 

```
poetry add swarms
poetry add swarms-tools
```
## Build a Simple Agent 
With Swarms, you can create *structures*, such as `Agents`, `Pipelines`, and `Workflows`, that are composed of different types of tasks. First, let's build a simple Agent that we can interact with through a chat based interface. 

```python
from swarms.structures import Agent
from swarms.utils import Chat

agent = Agent()
Chat(agent).start()
```
Run this script in your IDE and you'll be presented with a `Q:` prompt where you can interact with your model. 
```
Q: write me a haiku about swarms 
processing...

                             Input: write me a haiku about swarms

                             Skateboarding bliss.                               
A: Swarms on my board,
Keeps me steady, never slips,
Skateboarding bliss.
Q: 
```
If you want to skip the chat interface and load an initial prompt, you can do so using the `.run()` method: 

```python
agent.run("write me a haiku about swarms")
```
Agents on their own are fun, but let's add some capabilities to them using Swarms Tools. 
### Build a Simple Agent with Tools 

```python
from swarms.structures import Agent
from swarms.tools import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()

agent = Agent(
   tools=[calculator]
)

agent.run(
    "what is 7^12"
)
```
Here is the chain of thought from the Agent. Notice where it realizes it can use the tool you just injected to do the calculation.[^1] 
[^1]: In some cases a model might be capable of basic arithmatic. For example, gpt-3.5 returns the correct numeric answer but in an odd format.

```

## Build a Simple Pipeline

Let's define a simple two-task pipeline that uses tools and memory:

```python
from swarms.memory.structure import ConversationMemory
from swarms.structures import Pipeline
from swarms.tasks import ToolkitTask, PromptTask
from swarms.tools import WebScraper, FileManager


# Pipelines represent sequences of tasks.
pipeline = Pipeline(
    memory=ConversationMemory()
)

pipeline.add_tasks(
    # Load up the first argument from `pipeline.run`.
    ToolkitTask(
        "{{ args[0] }}",
        # Add tools for web scraping, and file management
        tools=[WebScraper(), FileManager()]
    ),
    # Augment `input` from the previous task.
    PromptTask(
        "Say the following in spanish: {{ input }}"
    )
)

pipeline.run(
    "Load https://www.swarms.ai, summarize it, and store it in swarms.txt"
)
```

Boom! Our first LLM pipeline with two sequential tasks generated the following exchange:

> Q: Load https://swarms.readthedocs.io, summarize it, and store it in swarms.txt  
> A: El contenido de https://swarms.readthedocs.io ha sido resumido y almacenado en swarms.txt.
