# Swarms Monetization Strategy 

As we navigate the AI industry, let's remember the wise words of Jeff Bezos: "The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you. It just works." In essence, customer-centricity and seamless experiences are key to our strategy. Saburo Arasaka encourages us to view the present from the future â€” we should be visionary and always ready for change.
