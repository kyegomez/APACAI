# Standard Operating Procedure for Transforming a Pretrained LLM into Production-Ready Enterprise Grade APIs on AWS

## Prerequisites:

Before starting the process, ensure the following:

1. You have access to the pretrained Large Language Model (LLM).
2. You have an AWS account with necessary permissions to create and manage resources ([AWS Account Setup](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)).
3. You have Terraform installed on your local machine ([Terraform Installation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)).
4. The application's source code is in a GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ([GitHub Actions Setup](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions)).

## Procedure:

### Model Preparation:

1. **Model Serialization**: Quantize with QLORA then Serialize the pretrained LLM using a format that's compatible with your chosen deployment framework, such as ONNX.

### Infrastructure Setup:

1. **Set Up AWS Resources Using Terraform**:

   - Write a Terraform script to provision necessary AWS resources ([Terraform AWS Setup](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-build?in=terraform/aws-get-started)).

2. **Model Deployment**:

   - Upload the serialized model to the created S3 bucket ([Uploading files to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html)).

### API Development:

1. **API Design and Implementation**:

   - Implement the API using a framework like Flask or FastAPI ([API Development with FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)).

### Continuous Integration and Deployment:

1. **GitHub Actions Setup**:

   - Define a workflow in GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment ([GitHub Actions CI/CD](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python)).

### Monitoring and Logging:

1. **Monitoring**:

   - Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health of the API and the underlying infrastructure ([Monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)).

2. **Logging**:

   - Configure your API to log important events and transactions ([Logging in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)).


Here are a few other sections that could be included to help de-risk the process of deploying a trained transformer model to millions of users:

## Security and Compliance:

This section should outline how to manage and protect user data, which could involve ensuring compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It can include guidelines on how to encrypt data in transit and at rest, manage access to the model and its outputs, and regularly audit security practices.

- **Data encryption**:
  - Use of AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing cryptographic keys for data encryption ([AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)).
- **IAM Policies**:
  - Use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS services and resources ([AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)).
- **Security Audits**:
  - Regularly auditing the system to detect any security loopholes or vulnerabilities.

## Scalability and Performance Tuning:

When deploying a model to be used by millions of users, ensuring scalability is essential. This section can provide guidance on designing the system for high availability and auto-scaling, using services such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and AWS Auto Scaling. This also includes guidance on how to optimize the performance of the model and the API to handle high traffic.

- **Load Balancing**:
  - Use of AWS Elastic Load Balancer for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets ([AWS ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)).
- **Auto-Scaling**:
  - Use of AWS Auto Scaling to maintain application availability and scale Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to defined conditions ([AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)).
- **Performance Tuning**:
  - Optimizing the model and API for better performance under high traffic.

## Disaster Recovery and Backup:

An essential section that describes how to protect the model and associated infrastructure from unexpected events or failures. This includes how to regularly back up the model, configuration files, and databases, and how to restore the system from a backup.

- **Backup**:
  - Regularly backing up the model and other critical data using services such as AWS S3 or AWS Backup ([AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/)).
- **Disaster Recovery**:
  - Planning for potential disasters and system recovery, including strategies such as multi-region deployment and the use of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for quick recovery.

## Continuous Learning and Model Updating:

Machine Learning models can become outdated as the data they process evolves over time. This section could provide a procedure for updating the model with new training data regularly and re-deploying the updated model while ensuring minimal downtime.

- **Model Updating**:
  - Process to regularly update the model with new data, test it, and replace the older model in production ([Continuous Training in ML](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning)).
- **A/B Testing**:
  - Process for running experiments on different versions of the model to evaluate their performance and select the best one for deployment ([A/B Testing in ML](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/run-multiple-model-variants-in-production-using-amazon-sagemaker-multi-model-endpoints/)).

## User Feedback and Error Reporting:

Finally, setting up channels for users to report bugs and give feedback can be crucial in identifying issues and areas for improvement. This section can include information on how to set up error reporting and user feedback systems.

- **Error Reporting**:
  - Use of AWS CloudWatch or similar services for error logging and reporting ([AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)).
- **User Feedback**:
  - Setting up channels (such as support emails, forms, etc.) for users to report issues and provide feedback.

Each of these sections adds a layer of robustness to the deployment procedure and increases the chances of successfully serving millions of users.
