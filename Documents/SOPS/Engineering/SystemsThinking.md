# Systems Thinking 
* At APAC AI, we're working to shape the future through technology. 
* To do this, we need to embrace systems thinking. This skill is as crucial as the ability to read and write code that actually accomplishes our end objective.
* Everything in the Universe has an input, a function, and a output. Every star, every Human, every cat, every thing imaginable.

```
input -> function -> output

```
* I call the function, middleware, or search algorithm because you are searching for an outcome based on your input.

## Systems Thinking Step-by-Step

1. **Identify Stocks and Flows:**
   Stocks are quantities that are measurable at a specific point in time. Flows represent the activities that increase or decrease stocks.

```
    Stocks      Flows
    [Developers] --> [Lines of Code] --> [Outstanding Bugs]
```

2. **Find the Connections:**
   Recognize how stocks and flows interrelate. For example, the number of developers can affect the rate of code production.

```
    [Developers] -- impacts --> [Code Production]
```

3. **Recognize Feedback Loops:**
   Changes in stock impact the flow, and the changes in flow affect the stock. This is a feedback loop.

```
    Positive feedback loop
    [More Developers] -- leads to --> [More Code] -- needs --> [More Developers]
```

```
    Negative feedback loop
    [Fewer Bugs] -- leads to --> [Stable Code] -- needs --> [Less Bug Fixes]
```

4. **Identify Delays:**
   The effect of an action isn't always immediate, this is a delay. For example, a new developer's impact on code production takes time.

```
    Delay
    [Hire Developer] -- delay --> [Increased Code Production]
```

5. **Create a Systems Map:**
   Draw a diagram to visualize all these elements and their connections. This is your systems map.

```
    Systems Map
    [Developers] --> [Code Production] --> [Outstanding Bugs]
    |                             ^                             |
    |                             |                             v
    [Hiring/Firing] <--- [Management] --> [Bug Fixing]
```

6. **Think in Loops, Not Lines:**
   Understanding cause and effect is crucial in systems thinking. It's not a linear progression, but a complex cycle.

```
    [Cause] -- impacts --> [Effect]
      ^                          |
      |                          v
    [Feedback] <---- [Adjustments]
```

7. **Consider the System as a Whole:**
   Always remember the context of the system and how the elements fit together as a whole.

```
    [Individual Elements] --> [The System] --> [The Context]
```

8. **Use Systems Thinking for Decision Making:**
   Use your understanding of systems to inform your decision-making process. Recognize how changes in one part of the system can impact the rest.

```
    [Changes] -- impact --> [System] -- informs --> [Decisions]
```

## Final Thoughts
* Mastering systems thinking requires practice. 
* Start small, applying it to familiar systems. 
* Over time, tackle more complex systems. 
* It's about understanding our world's complexity to create sustainable change and recognizing that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
* Let's shape the world together.
