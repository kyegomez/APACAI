# Standard Operating Procedure for Transforming a Pretrained LLM into Production-Ready Enterprise Grade APIs on AWS

## Prerequisites:

Before starting the process, ensure the following:

1. You have access to the pretrained Large Language Model (LLM).
2. You have an AWS account with necessary permissions to create and manage resources ([AWS Account Setup](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)).
3. You have Terraform installed on your local machine ([Terraform Installation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)).
4. The application's source code is in a GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ([GitHub Actions Setup](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions)).

## Procedure:

### Model Preparation:

1. **Model Serialization**: Serialize the pretrained LLM using a format that's compatible with your chosen deployment framework, such as ONNX or TensorFlow's SavedModel ([Model Serialization in TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load)).

### Infrastructure Setup:

1. **Set Up AWS Resources Using Terraform**:

   - Write a Terraform script to provision necessary AWS resources ([Terraform AWS Setup](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-build?in=terraform/aws-get-started)).

2. **Model Deployment**:

   - Upload the serialized model to the created S3 bucket ([Uploading files to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html)).

### API Development:

1. **API Design and Implementation**:

   - Implement the API using a framework like Flask or FastAPI ([API Development with FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)).

### Continuous Integration and Deployment:

1. **GitHub Actions Setup**:

   - Define a workflow in GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment ([GitHub Actions CI/CD](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python)).

### Monitoring and Logging:

1. **Monitoring**:

   - Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health of the API and the underlying infrastructure ([Monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)).

2. **Logging**:

   - Configure your API to log important events and transactions ([Logging in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)).

## Checklist:

1. [ ] Pretrained LLM is available.
2. [ ] AWS account is set up with necessary permissions.
3. [ ] Terraform is installed on the local machine.
4. [ ] Application's source code is in a GitHub repository.
5. [ ] GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository.
6. [ ] Pretrained LLM is serialized successfully.
7. [ ] AWS resources are set up using Terraform.
8. [ ] Serialized model is uploaded to S3 bucket.
9. [ ] API is implemented with Flask or FastAPI.
10. [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD are defined and functioning correctly.
11. [ ] AWS CloudWatch is set up for monitoring and logging.

Remember that each step, from infrastructure setup to monitoring, is critical for the successful deployment and operation of the API. Always adhere to best practices and ensure all checklist items are completed.
