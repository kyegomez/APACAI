### **Example Usage for `project` Documentation:**

**1. Getting Started**

```markdown
## Getting Started with `project`

Welcome to `project`, a package designed for [purpose of project]. This section will guide you on how to set up and make your first request.

### Installation
```bash
pip install project
```

### Your First Request
Using `project` is simple. Here's how to make a basic request:

```python
from project import OpenAI

chat = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = chat.generate("Hello World")
print(response)
```

Output:
```
Hello, user! How can I assist you today?
```
```

**2. Tutorial**

```markdown
## Fetching Data from Multiple IDs Asynchronously

Want to query multiple IDs simultaneously? No problem. Here's a tutorial:

```python
# Initialize
from project import OpenAI
chat = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define your IDs
ids = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]

# Ask them all the same question
responses = asyncio.run(chat.ask_multiple(ids, "How is {id}?"))

# Print responses
for id, response in zip(ids, responses):
    print(f"{id}: {response}")
```
```

**3. Systems Architecture**

```markdown
## Systems Architecture

The architecture of `project` is designed to be robust and scalable. Here's a breakdown:
