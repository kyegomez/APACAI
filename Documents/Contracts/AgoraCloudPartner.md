## **APAC AI & Agora Partnership Strategy with Data Centers and Cloud Providers**

**Objective**: Formulate a strategic partnership with data centers and cloud providers to leverage their infrastructure at no initial cost, offering them a range of incentives and rewards in return, ensuring mutual growth and a win-win collaboration.

### **Incentives & Rewards for Compute Providers**:

3. **Long-term Commitments**: Prioritize providers for future endeavors or projects, giving them precedence when APAC AI and Agora expand.
    
4. **Research Collaborations**: Offer cloud providers an opportunity to collaborate on cutting-edge AI research projects. Joint branding can enhance their reputation in the market.

5. **Exclusive Features & Products**: Give providers early access to research findings, products, and features before public releases.

6. **Data Management Solutions**: Offer advanced AI-driven data management solutions to optimize their storage and compute solutions.
