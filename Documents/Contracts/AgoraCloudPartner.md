## **APAC AI & Agora Partnership Strategy with Data Centers and Cloud Providers**

**Objective**: Formulate a strategic partnership with data centers and cloud providers to leverage their infrastructure at no initial cost, offering them a range of incentives and rewards in return, ensuring mutual growth and a win-win collaboration.

### **Incentives & Rewards for Compute Providers**:

1. **Revenue Share**: Offer a percentage of the revenue generated from deploying trained models to high-paying customers. This creates an environment where the more resources the provider gives, the more they stand to benefit.
   
2. **Volume-Based Bonuses**: Introduce tiered bonuses for providers based on compute hours utilized. As our model training scales up, they earn additional bonuses.
    
3. **Long-term Commitments**: Prioritize providers for future endeavors or projects, giving them precedence when APAC AI and Agora expand.
    
4. **Research Collaborations**: Offer cloud providers an opportunity to collaborate on cutting-edge AI research projects. Joint branding can enhance their reputation in the market.

5. **Exclusive Features & Products**: Give providers early access to research findings, products, and features before public releases.

6. **Data Management Solutions**: Offer advanced AI-driven data management solutions to optimize their storage and compute solutions.

7. **Access to AI Products**: Provide them with complimentary access to some of APAC AI's premium products or services, enhancing their operational efficiency.

### **Notes**:

- **Revenue Share**: The revenue-sharing model is designed to give a percentage of the income from a particular service to the compute provider. This ensures that the more users or clients Andromeda attracts, the more the provider earns.

- **Referral Bonus**: If the compute provider facilitates or introduces a consulting deal, they receive a part of the deal value.

- **Discounted Rates**: Offering exclusive discounts to the providers ensures they can access our services at a preferential rate.

- **Licensing Share**: If a company wants to utilize Andromeda for their proprietary use, a share of this license revenue goes to the provider.

- **Project-based Bonus**: On custom projects, a percentage of the project's value is given as a bonus to the provider if they play a significant role in its facilitation or execution.

- **Mutual Promotion**: By co-branding, both Andromeda and the compute provider can enjoy shared visibility and user trust.

- **Community Recognition**: Recognizing contributors not only from the open-source community but also from our partners (like compute providers) fosters collaboration and goodwill.
