## 5. Reason for Failure

Standard Oil's demise was primarily due to the legal decision that led to its breakup in 1911. The U.S. Supreme Court found the company guilty of monopolizing the petroleum industry through a series of abusive and anti-competitive actions.

The primary reasons for the company's downfall are:

1. **Monopolistic Practices:** Standard Oil used predatory pricing and secret deals with railroad companies to undercut competitors, which led to its control of approximately 90% of the U.S. refineries and pipelines by the late 1880s.

2. **Violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act:** The monopolistic practices of Standard Oil were in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, a federal law prohibiting any contract, trust, or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade.

3. **Legal Action and Breakup:** The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil must be dissolved because it was in violation of the Sherman Act, leading to the creation of 34 smaller companies.
