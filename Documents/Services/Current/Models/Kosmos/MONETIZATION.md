## Requirements

#### Datsets

## Sales
notes with call from Prime Padre
* Cold call Execs of radiology companies, 
* Create a proof of concept with an exec
* Talk directly with an exec

* Higher you go up, the more stubborn people get
* Why buy, why us, why now
* articulate ROI in plain business terms "analyze 1 mri with 98% with a detailed document accuracy of diagnosis in 2 seconds", just input the image => this is what it is, this is what is not => parallel diagnostication, swarms, multi agent debate, what is the mystery? => Ai look, Physican looks, then report is autonomously generated. Alot of painful latency, automate from image, physcian checks it, then report is autonomously generated. => Cardiologists orders report, package everything up into a package then articulate the business value proposition of this one stop shot package.

* Fear factor of AI implementation
* People don't understand, explain buisness ROI and articulate growth
* The selling factor is the leverage of the competition
* Empower, allow Humans to make the final decision

* Empower a gateway and remove bureatic latency
* supercharge Humans, 
* identify chokepoints => problems that are maximally inclined to allow for high value creation.

* Cashflow cashflow cashflow recurring revenue => reshape markets
* focus on creating amazing orca-like radiology datasets with detailed explanations and explain your reasoning 
* Get to efficient market with extreme accuracy at extreme speed

* be aware of rent seeking => vendor lockin is bad but you gurantee cashflow. 
* Microsoft has figured to get in low level positions like Government.
* Microsoft knew had a leeky operating system they then targted a chain => Common hardware reference platform before, every weapon system had the same OS, and exchange pieces and parts, 
* Component based architecture for military ops => hook on low level then we have to build higher level 

* Jedi project, contract was massive => microsoft used leveraging capacity to force into 4x amount over value. 
* When have the ability the run to seek rents,
* Everyone needs to feel competition, provide good value, good vision, not money in bank account.

* Consistent revenue flow, no vendor lockin, base level layer intact, 
* Push to the next layer in atmosphere
* Securitize but don't impede the competition from becoming dependent on you

* food distribution
* What are areas that are high disruptive with alot of cashflow? 
* Solve fundamental problems, 1st principles problems

* NET HUMAN UTILITY VALUE
* Don't apply stress team, don't apply pressure to team

* fundamental problem of is mri, patient past history => Kosmos-X => ouput: reliable and accurate analysis of the patients current health and data-backed understanding of the patients future
* Regulatory structures needs to be traversed
* sucessful radiologists will have super resolution monitors at their home and at the hospital, 

* The analysis of the image is the most important think, SAM, grounding, and explain your reasoning with text
* What is the average latency to understand an MRI
* The fundamental problem of radiologists is understanding the MRI

* provide references with claims and make sure it's reliable,

* express that end user makes more money if they use model
* Equity

* Latency action points in organizations, execs don't seem bottleneck downstreams
* Go fundamental levels


* Determine value propostions for each market

* find the fundamental cog in what an industry ticks and then automate it with multi-modality 
* healtcare => replicate 
* Understand first principle problems of each industry => Multi-Modality AI => Solve first principle problems

* Gain an deeper understanding
* Edge cases of a problem of a market

* go into a very specific radiological group 

* Complete 1 demonstration of how Kosmos comes into practice and how reliable it isn't.
* Cohortize

* TPA, Drug Administrator => administrative body looks at data from blueshield -> they shape data what drugs will they pay for, data is corrupted that it gets to the board
* You change environemntal conditions => medical pathologies change 

* alot of things are not represented in datasets
* 1st principle understanding, systematics of understanding, of 1st principles problems
* get people to with an atomic understanding of healthcare
* How can we attract deep domain experts of markets?

* Don't propose too new out of everybody's comfort level
* Return the customer's investment as fast as possible, provide the feeling that we are returning value as quickly as possible
* why buy, why us, why now 


to meet domain experts
* Meet alot of people, develop a trackrecord with people, deliver always deliver
* they want to make money
* they feel powerless with AI
*
