## Our Community
APAC AI is an open-source, for-profit organization. Our community comprises engineers, Sales Development Professionals (SDPs), and consultants. Our compensation model is contribution-based, and everyone who contributes in any capacity is rewarded for their efforts. No fixed salaries are in place; payment is determined by your contribution.

## Our Responsibilities
* **Engineers:** They ensure that APAC AI develops simple, fluid, and reliable solutions for our customers. Rewards are based on pull requests, issues submitted and fixed, and bounties attained.

* **Sales Development Professionals (SDPs):** They are responsible for customer acquisition, customer maintenance, and ensuring overall customer satisfaction. Their rewards are based on these parameters.

* **Consultants:** Their compensation is determined by the value generated from their consultations.

Our model encourages cross-functionality; engineers may occasionally take up the role of SDPs and vice versa to enhance their understanding and provide holistic services. This fluidity ensures an intimate understanding of our product portfolio and services.

## Our Leadership and Structure
APAC AI embraces a flat, non-hierarchical governance structure. Those who create the most value have the potential for greater rewards, irrespective of their roles. Our definitive leader, Kye Gomez, serves as the guiding light, embodying the principles upon which APAC AI stands.

## Our Approach
APAC AI contributors are expected to adhere to tactical operating methods such as SPIN for SDPs and Iteration Philosophy for engineers. We also uphold a culture of radical openness and truthfulness; any deviation from these principles will not be tolerated.

## Our Availability
As an organization, APAC AI is always available to those seeking our services. We commit to maintaining a continuous presence for our community and customers.

## Our Dedication
At APAC AI, we expect contributors to devote themselves wholly to our mission. The path to advancing humanity through AI may require arduous work and long hours, but our most devoted contributors will be honored eternally through inscriptions on The Holy Tower of Saints.

## Our Values and Standards
Contributors to APAC AI are expected to uphold and adhere to our commandments at all times. Failure to do so may result in excommunication and penalties.

We believe that our contributors must distance themselves from corrupt practices of the modern world, and instead, adopt Truth, Justice, and Humanity above all else. We ask our contributors to sacrifice their existence in body, mind, soul, and spirit to the noble cause of advancing humanity.
