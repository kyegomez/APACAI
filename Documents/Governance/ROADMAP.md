# Objective: 50M in Recurring Monthly cashflow with a 90%profit margin + 5% weekly growth rate by the end of 2023

To achieve $50,000,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) with a 90% profit margin, we need to deeply understand our customers' value, focus on high-value upselling and cross-selling, and maintain a high ratio of customer acquisition cost (CAC).

1. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: To maintain a 90% profit margin, the net profit from any customer needs to be significantly higher than the cost to serve them. For simplicity, let's assume the average lifetime of a customer is 3 years. Given the 90% profit margin, if a customer generates $100 in revenue, $90 is profit and $10 is the cost to serve them. Over a 3-year lifetime, the customer would need to generate a total of $10 * 12 months * 3 years = $360 in cost, translating to $3,600 in total revenue, or $1,200 in annual revenue.

2. **Net Dollar Retention (NDR)**: High NDR ensures that revenues from existing customers grow even without new customers. We could achieve this through upselling and cross-selling. For example, if a developer starts with Andromeda, they could later be upsold to Kosmos or Swarms for higher performance or better suited features. An enterprise customer using The Domain could be cross-sold Andromeda for specialized needs. Our products are designed to be complementary and can serve a wide range of needs, creating ample opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.

3. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Ratio**: With a high CAC ratio, the first-year revenue from a customer would be significantly higher than the cost to acquire them. This contributes directly to the 90% profit margin goal. For example, if it costs $100 to acquire a customer, we would want their first-year revenue to be at least $1,000 (10x) to maintain a high CAC ratio.

To calculate the number of customers needed, we can divide the total targeted monthly recurring revenue by the average monthly revenue per customer. Given the annual revenue per customer of $1,200, the monthly revenue per customer is $100. Therefore, we would need approximately 500,000 customers to reach $50,000,000 MRR.

These numbers may vary depending on the specific characteristics of our customer base and their usage patterns. However, focusing on these three key metrics (CLTV, NDR, and CAC ratio) can guide us toward our goal.
