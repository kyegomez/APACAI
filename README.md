# Roadmap

Andromeda and Kosmos are poised to redefine the intersection of language, understanding, and AI, heralding a new era of innovation and growth. Our mission is resolute: we aim to generate $50M monthly recurring cashflow by the end of 2023 while maintaining an astonishing 90% profit margin with a 5% week growth rate target. Here's our roadmap.

## Phase 1: Monetization of Andromeda and Kosmos

1. **PAID API:** Begin offering a paid API service for Andromeda and Kosmos. (Estimated starting price: $0.01 per API call)

2. **The Domain:** Monetize access to The Domain, allowing users to leverage its unique capabilities. (Estimated starting price: $25)

3. **Dedicated Capacity:** Sell dedicated computational power for Andromeda and Kosmos for exclusive usage. (Estimated starting price: $99,999/month)

4. **Hosted Fine-Tuning:** Provide fine-tuning services, offering bespoke solutions to businesses. (Estimated starting price: $500 per hour)

## Phase 2: Monetization of Swarms

1. **Paid API:** Provide a paid API service for Swarms, facilitating high-performing computations. (Estimated starting price: $0.01 per API call)

2. **The Domain:** Utilize The Domain as an additional avenue for revenue. (25$ at 100 messages every 12 hours )

3. **Dedicated Capacity:** Offer exclusive computational power to Swarms for dedicated usage. (Estimated starting price: $299,999/month)

## Phase 3: Monetization of The Domain

1. **Freemium Subscription:** Launch a tiered subscription model for The Domain, from everyday users to large-scale businesses. (Estimated starting prices: $0/month for Basic, $25/month for Individuals, $299/month for Small Businesses, $999/month for Medium Businesses, and $4,999/month +  for Large Businesses)

2. **Usage Performance Fee:** Implement a performance-based fee on top of subscription costs, charging more for higher usage rates. (Estimated starting price: 2% of usage cost)

## Phase 4: Massive Scale Monetization

1. **Broaden Market Scope:** Aggressively expand our customer base, targeting a diverse range of industries, from healthcare and education to government and tech companies.

2. **Enhance Product Offerings:** Continually improve our services, ensuring we stay at the cutting edge of AI development and deliver unparalleled value to our customers.

3. **Strategic Partnerships:** Develop strategic alliances with tech companies, promoting shared growth and increasing our market reach.

4. **Community Engagement:** Foster a strong developer community, incentivizing contributions and ensuring continuous innovation.

By adhering to this roadmap, we can confidently stride towards our goal of achieving massive-scale monetization. Each phase will bring us closer to realizing our ambition, setting a new standard in the AI landscape. Andromeda, Kosmos, and Swarms ‚Äì together, we can change the world.

### Key Performance Metrics

To maintain our growth trajectory and stay on the course of being both profoundly service-oriented and unimaginably profitable, we focus on three non-vanity metrics:

1. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: CLTV measures the net profit we make from any customer during the time they are paying for our service. It's not just about acquiring users; it's about acquiring profitable users. This metric directly reflects both our ability to retain customers and the profitability of those customers.

2. **Net Dollar Retention (NDR)**: NDR shows how well we‚Äôre monetizing our existing customers. It captures upsells, cross-sells, downgrades, and churn. A high NDR means that our revenues from existing customers are growing, even if we don‚Äôt add new customers, which is crucial for maintaining high profit margins.

3. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Ratio**: CAC Ratio measures the profitability of our customer acquisition efforts. It shows how much we earn from a customer in the first year of their subscription compared to what we spent to acquire them. A higher ratio signifies greater efficiency and profitability.

By focusing on these metrics, we are committed to building a business that doesn‚Äôt just grow but scales in a sustainable, profitable manner. Let's change the world together.
